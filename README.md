# Logic-Gates-in-Python

## Motive
While I was exploring Logic gates, I thought, why not simulate the same concept using python.
<br/> I started writing the code and found it so simple. I started from basic gates like AND OR NOT; after that, I moved slowly to the Half adder, subtractor, advanced Logic gates, comparator, etc. Still more to add.
